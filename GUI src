A DnD dice roller GUI that is writen in Java that 
takes user input then produces results and displays
past results.

The part that stumped me the longest was trying
to figure out how to implement the action performed 
on the radio button. I kept thinking that the if a 
certain radio button was pressed I would have to iterate
through the array to find what value that is pressed. 
But I eventually figured out that I would take the value
from the array convert it into a string then evaluate it
to determine what value was pressed to determine what 
the max value would be set as.
