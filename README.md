The main purpose of this program was to create a dice rolling application
that would basically be used during an online session of Dungeons and Dragons.

Dungeons and Dragons is a roll playing game that is based off of individuals 
imaginations and the freedoms provided by the Dungeon Masters story. In terms of
why this dice rolling application is needed is because I noticed that I was
using an online dice rolling website and figured that creating my own application
maybe an interesting task. Although there are thousands of programs already 
out there, my program is specificially designed for a DnD campaign. 

The program will take in 3 sents of inputs one for the number of times a dice
roll is made, the second is for the number of sides on a dice, and the final 
value is used as a modifier score that is based off of individal player characters.
